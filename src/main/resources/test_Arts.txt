review/summary: Making the cut!
review/text: Looked all over in art supply and other stores for "crazy cutting" scissors for my 4-year old grandson. These are exactly what I was looking for - fun, very well made, metal rather than plastic blades (so they actually do a good job of cutting paper), safe ("blunt") ends, etc. (These really are for age 4 and up, not younger.) Very high quality. Very pleased with the product.

review/text: These are the BEST scissors I have ever owned. I am left-handed and take note that either a left or right-handed person can use these equally well.If you have arthritis, as I do, these scissors are amazing as well. Well worth the price. I now own three pairs of these and have convinced many other people in my quilting group that they NEED a pair as well!They cut through muli layers and difficult to cut items really well.Do buy them, you won't regret it!

review/text: I finally gave in and bought these after years of wanting them. I'm so glad I did!I'm a book artist and crafter, and I usually do my creative work in marathon stretches. (You know, nothing for three weeks and then an all-day session...) These scissors make it so much easier. They cut easily and cleanly, with no hand fatigue. They also saved me when I did all my Christmas gift wrapping.I should have just bought these in the first place!

review/text: Like the previous reviewer, I was very happy to be able to order safety pins on-line. I live in a small town, and they are impossible to find. These safety pins are very large- about 2.25" long. Also, they are not very sharp. I used them to pin 2-3 garments together for a children's clothing resale, and had a VERY difficult time getting the point to go through in both directions. This was true on all types of fabric from denim to cotton to jersey. The dull point of one of these safety pins tore a hole in one polo-style, jersey shirt!

review/summary: Good quality, minor flaws
review/text: I bought these to make my own stretched canvases and to stretch some paintings I'd already done. When I got these, the first thing I noticed is they ranged greatly in color, dark wood to light wood. Although it's not really that important as only a very little bit of the frame shows through the back, and none at all once hanged. The only other thing I'd have liked is if they were cut a little more cleanly. The ends aren't as smooth as the picture and if you're not careful, they could easily give you a splinter.Other than that these are very nice. Once put together they seem sturdy and they're light enough to make hanging them not a problem. They make a great deal too.

review/summary: Great Buy
review/text: I actually bought this item from "Amazon Warehouse" used but "Like New" condition. When they say "Like New" it's pretty darn close. The compressor came in it's original box with all accessories in their original plastic package and the cords spooled up as if it came from the factory. I haven't yet seen a blemish on the unit itself. It really is in like new condition (and was $60 cheaper than a new unit from Amazon).This compressor is great. I was originally considering the Smart Jet (non-Pro) however what pushed me over is that if you lower the air pressure on the Smart Jet it achieves a lower pressure by a bleed valve which just lets the air run out. The result is that the auto-shutoff feature of the Smart Jet is then rendered useless and the compressor just runs constantly. This compressor however has a true regulator and you can decrease the pressure without loosing the auto-shutoff functionality. It also has a "protective case" around it.----------------------------Update October 2012A year and a half later and the compressor is still doing great. I also have a larger shop compressor used for pneumatic tools, and compare to that this unit is way quieter. The tank fills up in about 30 seconds then it shuts off and is quiet. It's nice to be able to paint things at night, 10PM or 11PM, without worrying about how it will affect others in the house or the neighbor. If I had to buy another air brush compressor for some reason... well, I think I might just buy a 2nd one of these.

review/text: I bought this to replace my Omas black ink that was running out to use in my Lamy 2000 fountain pen. The ink flows fine and gives even coverage on the two kind of paper I commonly use, I would definitely recommend it. The ink lost one star because it is a dark, dark grey rather than a true black as was the Omas but only suffers when held right next to one another. I don't know if this is due to the paper I am using. Also it seems this ink drys a little slower and thus smudges somewhat easier, this is NOT an objective measurement however but a feeling and obviously will depend on the paper used.

review/summary: The one ink everyone should start with.
review/text: I'm using this in a Lamy Safari. It starts right up on any kind of paper I've tried it on, including receipt paper at work. Flows smoothly from the pen without skipping. It's dull black, but perfect for professional situations or signatures with difficult paper. I'll buy again.

review/summary: Simply works like it's supposed to
review/text: This ink works as it's supposed to. I use it in a Lamy Safari Grey, and it has become my "main" pen. I use it for filling out repair orders at work, practicing handwriting, and filling out important documents and writing checks. This combination brings the tactile feel of writing back to mundane documents. I am not good at it but it has also brought a certain "organic" feel to my doodles and small cartoons, that otherwise would be lacking. Quality products are in short supply, be sure to support vendors/manufactures who continue to bring them to the public!!

review/summary: The Greatest Invention Since the Wheel!
review/text: I love this ink!I love using fountain pens, but I always have to carry a regular pen with me, because the ink isn't waterproof (no good for checks and important notes). Well now it is!This ink works great! It dries quickly, leaves a nice dark line, and is completely waterproof!I'm so thrilled about discovering this ink that I ordered it in a bunch of colors and even ordered some extra pens, because now I will be able to use my fountain pens for everything!The only drawback that I see about this ink is that it smells a bit (to my nose), but I don't inhale it I just write with it, so its benefits well out way this minor issue.WARNING!!! Noodlers gives you your money's worth--they fill the bottle to the very tippy-top! The first time you open the bottle, make sure it is on a level surface and open slowly and carefully. I recommend putting it on some newspaper or a paper towel to open.

review/summary: Simply the best
review/text: I purchased this ink before along with my first fountain pen. I like to sketch, and I find fountain pens complimentary to my art. This ink was VERY dark and got the job done.I live in earthquake-prone California, and a recent quake knocked books off of my shelf. My Noodler's ink was on the shelf as well and consequentially fell too, shattering the glass bottle. Luckily, the tile was wiped clean and the ink left no stain :)I decided that I would need replacement ink ASAP since I was working on a project. I headed over to an office supply store and bought a generic bottle of Parker Quink Ink in black. But as I started to sketch, I noticed that this ink was more of a gray in comparison to the almost abyssal Noodler's ink.Having said this, I am back to purchase another bottle of this Noodler's Bulletproof Black. It is simply the best.WARNING: This ink will spoil you for all other inks!

review/summary: Good Ink but NOT Waterproof
review/text: Doesn't feather, with a sharp, crisp, dense line. Slow dries on quality paper where it tends to sit on top rather than be quickly absorbed (cheaper paper). But where it fails as a drawing ink is that it lightly lifts when a wash of water is applied. Even lightly will kill a watercolor or colored ink wash. As long as you don't care about it being absolutely waterproof, this is a great ink, but if you require absolute waterPROOF (as opposed to water "resistant"), then this is NOT the ink you want.

review/summary: Takes a long time to dry
review/text: It is nice to have a fountain pen ink that is water proof. However, in this particular case it is at the cost of having an ink that takes forever to dry. This it almost impossible to use for left handed people, and one must accept the fact that when writing on multiple pages, there will be ink smears on the pages that touch each other. It's definitely good to have when signing documents or checks, but one can use a simple permanent pen from any office store for that limited use. Buyer beware!

review/summary: Wonderful Ink
review/text: The bottle the ink came in was filled to the brim, which was very satisfying to a penny-pincher like me. Bulletproof black flows nicely out of my charcoal Lamy Safari with a Fine nib; it also complements the color of the pen very nicely. Like other reviews have noted, the ink performs much better than expected on even poor quality paper. But it also kind of depends on the size of the nib you're using and how wet your pen writes. But in most of the pens I've used, there hasn't been too much variance.The color of the ink is just a touch lighter than I would like, but its very dark nonetheless. I'm not too sure if the product info page lists it, but the bulletproof black is fraud-proof and pretty much permanent on paper. The ink works by bonding chemically to cellulose, the stuff paper is made of, but it'll wash out of your hands and pen without too much difficulty. Just make sure you don't spill the ink on a white shirt or something.Just as a warning, some fountain-pen users and some repair-guys don't encourage the use of Noodler's bulletproof black in fountain pens due to the possibility of clogging due to the high solute content in the ink. But if you're using a fairly inexpensive pen, like the Lamy Safari, then it really isn't that much of a concern. From what I can tell, the potential damage is VERY minimal, especially compared to the great qualities of this ink. The only other potential problem I can see with the bottle they provide is when the ink level is really low; it'll make refilling with a converter or piston kind of difficult. The way I plan on getting around this is by using a syringe to refill my old cartridges. But I can definitely see how the bottle design could pose a problem for refills.

review/summary: A great upgrade...Increases the utility of the pen it's in
review/text: I recently received a Sheaffer calligraphy set that I have been really enjoying. The pen was fine, but I was having difficulty using the pen for writing in Blackletter. When it came to replace the ink, I decided to fill the converter with Noodler's (rather than use one of the disposable cartridges that came with the set) to see if I could tell the difference. It was night and day. I literally stopped mid-line changed ink, and it was astounding. Rather than being pulled through the paper and spreading out like the Sheaffer ink did, the Noodler's stayed right where I wrote. This led to a much more pronounced effect in my writing, with much sharper edges on my calligraphy. I was having trouble getting the squared look before, but now my thicks are squared and my thins remain thin. I recommend this ink to anyone that is considering using bottled ink over cartridges. I have not tested the long term use of this ink in my pens, but I am predicting no issues (it works well in my other fountain pens nicely). I look forward to being a customer of Noodler's for many years to come!

review/summary: fast-drying and waterproof
review/text: I have seen a few gripes around that noodler's ink does not dry quickly. In my experience this isn't true; while you can't rub the paper up on your face moments after writing, Noodler's bulletproof black seems to dry faster than the Lamy black ink I had earlier. In any event, it's by no means slow-drying. It's also definitely waterproof; all the other reviews don't lie. I know the dyes bond with cellulose, making a mark that can't be washed away, but having seen it in action, I'm pretty sure it's just magic.As for the color, it is a pure black. Don't expect all your writing to convey the darkness of beyond the event horizon; quick writing with a fine nib will still leave some under-covered spots showing a little grayishness, but you certainly won't see any purple/blue fringing or anything like that.

review/summary: ***** I LOVE THIS INK *****
review/text: Review of 'Noodler's Black Waterproof Fountain Pen Ink - Bulletproof'First of all, I love this product. I highly recommend it and I would definitely buy it again.Here's why: It is black as opposed to blue black, it is smooth, it glides easily, there is no smudging as it dries quickly on paper but never on the nib, and it works beautifully on my Moleskine notebook as it does on regular (cheap) ruled notebook paper. I doubt it is meant to be used to draw, however, I used it to do some quick calligraphy on a used, dry coffee filter and it worked with minimal (insignificant) bleeding even on that coarse paper.Type of pens used: (1) Waterman classic (France), medium nib, with twist converter cartridge. (2) Alvin Reform Refographs (Germany - two decades old), sizes .50 (size 2) and .30 (size 00). Because the Waterman was clean and completely dry when I filled the cartridge, the ink flows pretty much solid black. Because the Refographs were freshly washed and the cartridge as well as the nib casing contained water, the ink flow varies from grey (more of a heather grey than a bluish grey) to black. Under no conditions have I seen any bleeding from this ink, not even when spotted with drops of water (once dry on paper). Big thumbs up from me.Because the ink comes in a glass bottle a few inches high, and the ink is nearly overflowing over the rim of the bottle, it is very easy to reload the Waterman twist converter. I am not sure how I will 'suck' up the ink from the bottom of the bottle once I use it up. For the Refographs, because they have disposable cartridges that I have always refilled, I used a new nose/ear bulb (yeah, yeah, the blue ones used to extract boogers from babies' noses!) from the pharmacy to refill the cartridges. But I'm pretty sure any other dropper or even a syringe would have worked as well as long as the whole refilling process is done with care. Perhaps I will do the same with the Waterman converter when its time comes around.While some reviewers criticize the ink as not being 100% black, I found that for the way I use my pens, mainly for writing, the ink is more than adequate in opacity and in warmth (I cannot stress enough how I dislike blue black inks - just personal preference). I hope this review helps you.

But after reading some Amazon reviews, I finally decided to buy the Noodler's Ink.Simply, the Noodler's ink is superior. Only the shape of the Montblanc bottle is better than the Noodler's bottle, but because I had my empty Montblanc bottle I poured the new ink on it and now I have the best of two worlds.

Overall, a quality ink that will be my preferred ink of choice from here on forward.Bad:Although the manufacturer and other people who have posted comments made high remarks regarding the "bulletproof" nature of this ink... I found that it still smudged when wet. It wasn't waterproof. To place some context into my comment, I wrote with the ink and allowed time for the ink to dry. I sealed my letters and wrote the address on the envelope. I awoke the next morning to mail out my letter, BUT... ran my finger under the tap and "smudged" the ink. Viola! The ink still smudged. I will say that while the ink did smudge... it wasn't illegible. I could still read the address and thus, off it went into the post.

However, in my experience, it just isn't the dense black that I was looking for.The good:- it is definitely waterproof!- it works in technical pens (no problems with clogging in my Rapidograph)- fast dryingThe bad:It's thin. Watery. Not dense. The only time I couldn't see through it to the paper is when I applied it with a brush. For that, I have a fabulous array of India inks etc to choose from. Even with a brush pen it was more charcoal than black.I will try more of Noodler's Inks, but this one is not the black that will make me stop looking for a better one.

review/summary: Nearly the Perfect Black
review/text: I've been using Noodler's Bulletproof Black for about six months in a variety of fountain pens. I have a number of pens, use several papers, and have more than a handful of different inks. My bottle of Noodler's BB has more removed from it than my other colors.Once dry, this ink is permanent. That's what I wanted (originally for my journals) and that's what I got. BB is also well-behaved in the pens I use it in. This list includes several Parker 51s, a couple of Esterbrooks, a Waterman Phileas, and a Lamy Al-Star.Beware if you are considering using it in a dry-writer -- you might not like the flow. For example, I originally bought my Lamy Al-Star with an extra-fine nib. That's a relatively dry-writing nib and the flow from that pen was insufficient for my writing style. Use of a slightly wetter-writing Fine nib solved the problem, but it is something to watch for.Others mention "nib-creep" -- the tendency for some inks to leave the space between the nib's tines and coat the nib lightly. This bothers some people (not me) so be aware that it might happen. It's harmless to the pen, at least in my experience. Hooded pens (like the Parker 51 and others) hide this but I'm sure it's there.BB dries fairly quickly and bonds with the paper as it does. I have not experienced much feathering, bleeding, or ghosting with BB on a variety of papers, including standard copy paper, Moleskine journals, and higher-quality papers like Clairfontaine and heavy HP laser-printer paper.Did I mention that it's BLACK? :) I suppose there are other inks available that might be more black, but BB is black. My favorite rollerball (and my go-to pens before I jumped to fountain pens) was a Uniball Signo DX (hard to find in the US) in black. BB is just as black as the ink in that rollerball.In short, if you're looking for a black, permanent ink for a fountain pen, Noodler's BB can do the job. It's relatively fast-drying and as permanent as any ink can be. It's recommended.

I've tested several black ballpoints and rollerballs against this ink and Noodler's came out darker, thicker, smoother, and all around better looking. It's going to take me a while to burn through this bottle, but you can bet I'll buy Noodler's from now on.

review/summary: I Wish My Penmanship Was as Beautiful
review/text: I got my ink last night and I had a chance to test it out on several different types of paper, and I am impressed to say the least. It was very well behaved on each type of paper and I didn't notice any feathering or bleed through (which is great because I'm a lefty and I press hard). If you are looking for some black ink, definitely give this a look.

review/summary: Quality daily ink
review/text: This is very good daily-use ink. All around good performer on various paper types, so long as they aren't treated or too slick.I've put this into various pens, including a newer Scheaffer, an older Montblanc, a Parker 21 and an Esterbrook. Various nib sizes, extra fin, fine and medium. Worked well in all of them, no blobbing, dripping, running..lays a thick dark black line like it's supposed to.The "eel" version apparently has a bit more lubrication in it. Same price Haven't noticed too much difference but I wrote a review there as well, so check it out.

review/text: The ink is a nice dark black, its waterproof once dry and works in synergy with my Lamy Studio-- AKA the writing is extremely smooth. Just make sure to clean out your pen every 3 or 4 fill ups because ink can get crusted on the inside and block the flow.

review/summary: Amazing Ink
review/text: I am a recent fountain pen convert, and I have to say, I love this ink! I have been using it in a Waterman Phileas, and Lamy Safari (both medium nibs), and found it to work well on most paper types, with smooth flow. Completely water and common solvent (acetone, methanol, ethanol) proof. I'm a chemist, and I love that I can use this to write in my lab notebook (goodbye crappy lab pen!). Superior to Parker Quink (black) that I used, although I had an old bottle.I will definitely be exploring more of these Noodler's inks!

review/summary: All the positive reviews can't be wrong, right?
review/text: Despite all the great reviews for this bottle of ink, I was a little hesitant due to some of the negative reviews. I wanted to use it in myLamy Safari Charcoal Extra Fine Point Fountain Pen - L17EFafter buying theLamy Refill Converter (LZ24)for it, but I read some reviews stating that this ink might not work properly/very well with an extra fine nib, and that it would work better in aLamy Safari Fountain Pen, Charcoal Medium Nib (L17M), which I own as well, or one with a fine nib. I also read reviews questioning the "Bulletproof" qualities of this ink (water proof, forgery proof, etc.) and the "blackness" of the color. All this made me just a little bit nervous in making the purchase.However, after some thought, reason and logic kicked in and I just went ahead and bought it. Am I happy with my decision? You bet'cha! Not only does it work just great in my Lamy Safari fountain pen with extra fine nib, but it appears to be pretty "bulletproof" and "black" to me! I mean, the ink does smudge just a tad bit if you wet your finger and run it across the page, but it will not come off the page and is still very legible. It also writes and stays as black as I could want it to. After seeing the ink in action, all of my fears and anxiety subsided and I have no complaints to report. After all, all the positive reviews can't be wrong, right?

review/summary: OUTSTANDING!!
review/text: My first fountain pen was/is a Cross. It is a lower end cost pen that is black and gold with a gold tip. It looks more expensive than it really is but this pen is no longer produced by Cross. I purchased the fountain pen to set my writing apart from other's on legal documents at my place of employment. (this simple application of a fountain pen has saved me many headaches) One person in the field who was seriously incompetent finally caused me to blow my cork after dealing with his idiocy for five years. Before I knew it, I had thrown my fountain pen against the console. The damage that resulted was the plastic under the gold point lost about a millimeter at the tip. The ink no longer flowed properly. I have since purchased 2 more Cross pens, a Parker and finally a Lamy. None feel as good as the black and gold Cross I damaged in a stupid fit. (in my defense...it did take 5 years for me to reach my breaking point) I have also tried 3 different types of ink and none seemed to work well in the other pens either. I always had to kick start the line before I could write. I purchased this Noodler's ink as a last ditch effort and low and behold, it worked well on ALL the pens. On a whim, I tried it on my old #1 Cross pen and it brought the old girl back to life. This American made ink is OUTSTANDING! It flows well but does not pour out of the pen like water from a tap. I have read a review that said it was clumpy. I know mixing inks in a pen can cause clumps if the pen is not thoroughly cleaned before changing inks. All I know is that this ink could have saved me some bank had I purchased it from the get go as I now, once again, only use my black and gold Cross and the other purchased fountain pens sit in a pewter holder at home.

review/summary: It is ok, just a little let down
review/text: This ink looks great, compared with my Parker Quink ink, and some Platinum preppy ink I tried. But everyone seemed to brag about how quickly this ink dries. I find it not to be so, especially on card stock. It fails my inmediate smear test (1 or 2 seconds, seems ok after 6 seconds). If you think that is too short, my Quink ink passes this test easily, same with the ink on my disposable pens (Pilot Varsity, Itoya Blade, even my Platinum preppy). The smear is about par with the ink that came in my Lamy safary.The cap appears to be a bit cheap, I dropped it and cracked the cap (while inside the box it came with), so you do have to be careful (the Quink bottle cap looks very strong made, for comparison).On the plus side, it is the only ink I have tried that will not bleed through cheap paper, even when I intentionally scribbled in one small spot, laying a lot of ink. All others I tried bleed through when doing that.But this is permanent ink, so be sure to carry it in a pen carrier in your pocket, not by itself, just in case. It will bond to paper and clothes. But it washes off without too much trouble from my fingers (my Quink is hard to wash off).

review/summary: Black Noodlers Ink - Catfish Label
review/text: I like the way the ink flows from both my Parker Calligraphic and Sheaffer Calligraphic pens . . . however, it is not the dense, opaque black that I expected, nor is it waterproof on paper. I used it in the converters of the pens mentioned . . . flowing is excellent with no noticeable feathering on less than optimum paper. A good, solid, ink tending more to gray than the dense black that I prefer. Bottled and shipped very well. The bottle, 3 ounces, is easily accessible by any fountain pen that I am aware of.

review/summary: Disappointed at first, but now I am quite impressed (UPDATE)
review/text: I recently bought this ink on amazon to use in my extra fine Lamy Safari. I am very disappointed with it. It doesn't flow well from the nib and it dries to more of a gray than a real black. I'm very surprised because all of the other reviews I read said that it was a very black black. The other ink I have used in my Lamy is Noodlers Polar Brown, which makes the pen handle much more smoothly. I think I might go for the polar black and see how that works for me. Perhaps I got a bottle from a bad batch, or maybe its just not a good match for the extra fine nib I'm using. Either way, from my experiences so far I wouldn't recommend getting this ink.Update 10/23/12:After my initial review this ink started to change the way it handled in my pen. It may have been that I had cleaned my pen out prior to using it so it was a little watered down. Now I love it. It flows smoothly, and is very fine writing experience. The initial bottle I bought has lasted me 3 years and it is only half gone! Get it, you won't be disappointed.

review/summary: Forget Brand Name, Noodler's Black ink has the most bang per buck!
review/text: Just ordered this for my Noodler's Ahab Flex pen, and it is great!Tips though:- If you're using a Noodler's pen like me, take out the nib and feed (black part under nib) and scrub it clean with water and soap, and put it back. A lot of users with either the ink and/or pen complain because they haven't done this- When you first get this bottle, slowly open it as you will see that it is filled to the brim with ink!On the most conventional paper like 20lb copier paper or filler paper, this ink won't bleed through the other side (unless you put blobs of ink then it will). Feathering, nope. But it may on other papers, I haven't experienced any. The darkness of this ink is as black as Pilot gel ink as used in the Pilot G-2 pen. Drying time is about a few seconds if not less than that.When filling my pen, the ink level in the bottle barely went down (and that's saying something, my pen holds more than a cartridge). This should last me a long time.For more detailed information on the "Bulletproof" qualities on this ink, visit the company's website, but in short it is (supposedly, I have no reason to test them) water proof, bleach proof, as well as archival quality. Good thing it washes off hands easily!Seeing as you'll be dipping the body of the pen into ink, you should know the ink will drip off a plastic body (like celluloid) as you pull the pen out so no worries about having to grip an inky pen. I will say this, "nib-creep" as described by other reviewers, I have experienced as well. Wiping the nib clean will only bring up more ink so I just leave it alone. No biggy, I have 3 oz. of ink anyway.UPDATE 2/5/2013: Works well with the Parker 45 with the Deluxe Parker Converter. When using a Fine nib, this thing lays down a little more ink than the Noodler's Ahab, but it glides on copier paper like glass.

review/summary: Superb, Smooth Ink!
review/text: This ink has been absolutely fantastic!While I can't attest to many different types of paper or pens (being a beginner), I do know that the ink performed flawlessly on notebook paper, in my Lamy and on a dip pen.Pros:- Smooth. It glided flawlessly in my Lamy and with a dip pen.- Very black.- Quick-drying. I've used it to take all my notes in college. I never had to wait for it to dry on notebook paper or flashcards; the only time it took a moment was with shiny cardstock (which is an awful surface, and it still dried fairly quickly!)- Large amount of ink.Cons:- Pervasively stains hands/very hard to remove from non-paper surfaces. I didn't lower the rating, since this is something you should expect of a permanent ink! Still, since I spilled almost the entire bottle, I did have to confront how insidiously difficult the stuff is to clean up.- Weak lid that did not resist a small drop. While the bottle/lid were fine for normal use, you may want to move the ink into a new bottle if you're clumsy. I knocked mine over the edge of a low table (1 to 1 1/2 feet) onto a hard floor; the lid immediately cracked and flew off, and I was down one (mostly full!) bottle of ink! This has nothing to do with the ink, however, and there's no real reason it should come in a deluxe bottle, so the rating remains a 5.All in all, I'm most certainly ordering another bottle of this black! I'd also recommend it to any other beginners out there looking for a solid, well-behaved first ink.

review/summary: Fantastic Ink
review/text: I have been using this ink in myLamy Refill Converter (LZ24)in theLamy Safari Fountain Pen - Charcoal - Fine.A few great points about this ink:1. It dries quickly.2. It is water resistant. I even tried writing on a sheet of paper and running the paper under water for several minutes and there was no bleeding and even rubbing the paper didn't cause the ink to bleed.3. It doesn't feather at all on most paper and only very little on cheap paper.4. The ink lets you write on both sides of most types of paper!5. The color is fantastic. I know it sounds silly to say this about black ink, but this is a true, deep, beautiful black. It is not like the "black" you get from most ballpoint, roller ball, or gel ink pens.The only thing I'm not wild about is that once the bottle gets lower, it become progressively more difficult to refill the converter, but the sheer joy of writing with this ink makes this a non-issue for me.

review/text: After getting my bottle, I wrote a few sample words and doodles with every pen and ink I own on a sheet of paper. Getting this sampler thoroughly wet, only two inks remained: Noodler's Waterproof Black and Sharpie Permanent. Sure, you could read some of the other colors and brands, but Noodler's had literally no change.I tried to rub the wet paper some, and the paper came apart before the ink showed any smears.I've written 20 or 30 pages with this ink in a Lamy Safari Extra Fine Nib with no clogs, goops, or issues.

review/text: It writes and stays on the paper. I'm not as technical as some people with ink but I wrote on a page of the cheapest notebook paper I could find and soaked it for a week in water. The paper nearly disintegrated but the ink was still there. Lines were long gone. I didn't buy this ink for that purpose; I bought it because it's BLACK. And it is, along with being a safe black for all of my pens. If you need a waterproof ink that's black, buy this. No questions asked. There's no screwing around with batch numbers or lot codes. It's Noodler's, and that means you're getting great ink.

I wrote a sample page, waited less than a minute, then put it in my son's bath water (good thing the wife didn't see that) and it still looked amazing. The only paper I've seen feathering on so far is the cheap Post-It note paper.Lots of ink for the price, made in the USA, and better than anything else I've tried in 20+ years of fountain pens.

review/summary: Very good ink
review/text: I used the Noodler Bulletproof Black ink with my new Hero 329 extra fine pens. The ink is excellent! My new pens wrote a nice fine line the very first time. I did not see any feathering even on newsprint! It also worked very well on regular copy paper and the ink dried very quickly. I highly recommend this bulletproof ink! I only sign my checks with this ink now.Update: I bought a Z24 converter for my Lamy Safari Extra Fine nib fountain pen so that I can use the Noodler ink. Surprisingly, the Noodler Black ink seems lighter and more watery from the Safari XF nib than from the Hero XF nib. The original Safari blue cartridge that came with the pen had a richer line. In addition, there is now a smear on the nib whereas there was none with the Lamy cartridge. Since I used the same ink for two different pens with two vastly different results, I must conclude that it's the nib that is causing the difference and not the ink itself.I downgraded this ink to 4* since it was a little disappointing that the ink did not exhibit the same characteristics in 2 different pens.

review/summary: My Favorite Ink
review/text: I have been using Noodler's ink for several years now in my Waterman Carene, Namiki Vanishing Point, and a special Keweco Sport pen modified into an eyedropper pen. It flows wonderfully through all of them, they write smoother, the ink is jet black opaque. Reminds me of the Higgins drafting ink I used to use in Rapidograph pens years ago. Lately I'm using it in my new Lamy All Sport pen with the Lamy converter and an EF nib. Who cares if ink streaks on the nib? After a year my Namiki was not flowing well so I took it down and flushed it with tap water and rinsed with distilled water (in case the Noodler's was sensitive to the minerals, etc. in my tap water). That was several months ago and the Namiki writes great. Sometimes pens should be cleaned out periodically. I refill the Waterman and Namiki cartridges using a syringe and reuse the cartridges (flushed the old ink out of them before adding Noodler's). I am going to use Noodlers Polar Brown in a Stipula Passaporta italic pen for calligraphy or handwritten letters. By the way, Noodler's ink will not attack any metals. Other inks can corrode metals. Visit Noodler's web site. Or, add other ink to a piece of aluminum foil and see it eat a hole in the foil over a day or so. Noodler's will not. Shake the bottle before you fill your pen. If it gets too thick dilute it with a little distilled water (I have not needed to do that yet).

review/summary: This is merely okay.
review/text: So I read the reviews and expected this to be the be-all, end-all of black ink. It's... okay.I am told it is waterproof and solvent-proof and ultimately "bullet-proof". I am not sure how much of a problem that is really solving, since I have signed mortgages with generic ballpoints, but let's say that it's very secure ink by some standard, and set that aside. It will still smudge weeks later, in any case.In more practical terms, this is not what I expected. It's smudgy and inky and "wet-looking" on, for example, post-it notes, envelopes, and office-paper. It takes a minute or two to dry, and leaves a "watery" look, not the solid-black "comic book" look I was hoping for based on the name and reviews.I am right-handed and I cannot imagine that this could possibly work for lefties. I start smudging when my hand brushes the previous line on ordinary office paper. Maybe I am not writing on sufficiently high-quality paper, or maybe I am writing too fast for this ink, but I had the impression that this was some kind of fast-drying, no-feather "superblack", like what you get in good drafting/artist/technical pens, or maybe even like good roller-gel ballpoints, except with the fluidity and stroke-quality of a fountain-pen.On the plus side, it flows well and instantly from the pen, with manageable bleeding/feathering. I don't have reason to doubt to archival/security claims, but those also seem like a solution in search of a problem, so to speak... if anything I write will ever be needed a thousand years from now, well, I hope someone will have copied it by then, and fading ink is not at the top of the list of destructibility/losability fears for me. Take it as you will.On the minus, or at least "no better than cheap india ink" side, this ink takes a good minute or two to dry on regular office paper using a fine-point Lamy nib. It also leaves a grayish, watery look, not a deep and consistent black, as I expected. Bleed and feathering are manageable, but this is not like writing/drawing with, say, a Koh-I-Noor drafting pen and ink.The dried ink on the page looks soaked-in and watery-gray. It's not "bad" or "wet" in terms of bleed/feathering, but it's not like the hard-edged bead of deep black that I thought it would be.As a writing ink, it's not fast-drying enough and offers only adequate appearance. As an artist's ink, it is flawed and inadequate. It offers neither the deep black nor crisp edges for detailed drawing.I don't doubt the security claims, so take those as they are worth to you. But as an everyday writing ink, this is only so-so. As a drawing ink, it fails.

review/summary: Love it
review/text: I was using Monte blanc ink and I love the shape of that ink well. The ink itself is lacking because it tends to smudge and runs easily with just a drop of water. So I did a search for waterproof ink and found this product. I have to say I am thoroughly impressed. I write about 10-20 pages a day as class notes and writing creatively. The ink does not feather as you write and stays in a crisp and clear line on most paper except glossy magazine cover. But even then once it dried I could place it under the sink faucet and wet it and it held up better than the ink already printed on the paper. Overall a wonderful product. However, I have one complaint. The shape of the bottle will undoubtedly cause problems later, as I use up a lot of ink. It will become difficult to fill the pen cartridge as the bottle empties.Update:I forget exactly when I bought this, The review says last January so I must have bought it before then. So a year now and I haven't used as much of this ink at all. I write A LOT. This ink really does go far. I have filled up a moleskin notebook, half of a second one, written college class notes and papers, and written a two person RPG with a friend of mine taking up almost an entire pack's worth of notebook paper. "Wow" is all I can say. I've used up the ink only in the very top of the bottle. I've only recently reached the top of the label. I am getting to the point of transferring this ink to a different bottle but I was shocked when I realized how long it had been.

It is "bulletproof" on paper, meaning it won't come off with water, alcohol, bleach, etc. For this reason, it's a great ink for signatures and addressing envelopes.This ink has other wonderful properties. It has good flow, yet it does not feather or bleed through pretty much any paper. I can even use it to do crossword puzzles in most books and newsprint with no feathering or bleeding. Most importantly, this ink is just black. Actually, it's blacker than black. I use it for writing notes and homework solutions. The text is so dark on white paper that I can easily scan my notes and solutions electronically to give to students.A few months ago I dropped my bottle of Noodler's black and broke it. I figured I wouldn't buy a new bottle because I have so many other black inks. However, it didn't take long before I missed it and bought I new one. It's the one ink every fountain pen owner should have.

review/summary: Very nice ink.
review/text: I am not an expert on ink or fountain pens. I use this with a Lamy Safari Demonstrator and an EF nib, with the converter. Have been using it for about a month, almost daily during that time.At first the ink was drying dark grey. I was disappointed. Then I started using a different kind of paper and refilling the converter by dipping the nib into the ink instead of trying to refill the converter by itself. After that, black ink. I suspect it was more the paper than the ink filling method that made the ink black or gray. It's been a nice black on every paper I have used it on since that first day though.Waterproof. Dries very quickly (almost instantly) on every paper I have used it on, even - to my surprise - parchment. Smudge proof almost immediately - within about a second for me. Flows nicely. Nice density. And even though I am going through it rather quickly at one refill every four days (as I am filling up a very detailed research journal which must be archival), there is still lots and lots left.You do get nib creep, but that doesn't do anything. I don't care if there's ink on the nib. I care if it writes smoothly, is waterproof, and works well in my pen. It does. So...as far as I know about pens and ink... I would say this is the best I have used. Take that as you will, since my experience is not extensive with fountain pens.

review/summary: Bright black on white paper
review/text: I really love this ink while using my Ahab flex pen. The black really stands out on white paper with such contrast. The ink is really, really wet and I had waited almost 3 minutes for my thick lines and dots to dry. I still have to blot it afterwards but it looks fantastic. When I discovered that water can wash away the Lamy ink I quickly sought Noodler's Black to keep my notes. It works fine on my regular notepad for work, feathering a bit if I linger to long. On 90g Clairefontaine paper it writes like a champ: smooth but no feathering and bleedthrough. I guess I need heavier and more compatible paper going forward.Some trouble for Tops Computational graph paper and I haven't figured out the root-cause:The ink does not seem to stick on Tops Computational Paper, forcing me to double back to retrace. I had previously used gel ink pens to scribble diagrams with ease but found my fountain pens with this ink were simply skipping or "railroading" on this paper. If anyone has any ideas what attribute of paper is causing this please let me know ~

review/summary: A great, easy flowing, black ink
review/text: I use this ink in a Pilot Plumix with a converter (not exactly the most high brow pen) and it flows like a dream. The is nice and dark with out spidering out, even on some pretty crappy paper I have used. It cleans up pretty easily with water if it is spilled on plastic or other similar surface, but is very durable on paper. I haven't had any problems with smearing even a few moments after writing something.

review/summary: Noodler's BP Black
review/text: Noodler's (Bullet Proof) Black is a good, very saturated black ink for use in any fountain pen.What I like about the ink:- It's really black. Not the blackest ink in existence, but it's much blacker than other widely available black inks.- It's one of the few fountain pen inks that's really waterproof. It can withstand great punishment without washing off the paper at all.- It flow really well. Almost all fountain pens can use this ink without any problems.- It lubricates the pen really well, writing with this ink in combination with a good fountain pen is will make the pen glide across the paper.- It comes in a large, filled to the brim bottle.What I don't like about the ink:- If you have a pen that's prone to nib creep, this ink will creep. It won't diminish your writing experience, but ink can pool on the top of the nib.- It's hard to clean. Once you're done with this ink, flushing your pen might take a little longer than you're used to.I can recommend this ink to anyone who is looking for a good, permanent, black ink. I gives this ink 5/5, minus one for the nib creep and difficulty to clean. (Though it's not the worst I've ever seen.)

review/text: I haven't found a better ink than this one! I love Noodler's ink, especially this waterproof black. It writes smooth and doesn't gob up at the nib. Not to mention, it is domestically made. It really doesn't get better than this ink. Some may argue that the black is not dark enough, but I prefer a little bit of shading. I believe that it gives your writing character!

review/summary: Great Family Game
review/text: We bought this game for our two children when they were 3 and 4, and we were pleasantly surprised at how enjoyable it is to play, even for mom and dad. It isn't a competition game as much as it is a cooperation game, so if having a clear cut winner is what you want, this probably isn't the game for you.Each player has a farm with four different crops to harvest before autumn turns to winter. You roll the die to determine which crop you may pick or if you have to move everyone closer to winter. If winter comes before the crops are harvested, then there might not be enough food for winter, but the object is for everyone to harvest their crops before the onset of winter.The neat thing about this game is that really the best way to get the harvest in is for everyone to work together to harvest each other's crops and not just work individually on your own crop. There is an additional element (which we have not yet played) to the game where you can plant the garden first and then harvest it. It is for more advanced players, but I think a young player could easily play it too after having played the easier version a few times.I highly recommend this game for families of all ages. It's been a blessing to watch the kids want to help other players more than they want to harvest their own crop!

She has difficulty playing other games (she can get rather upset when she loses - you know how that is!), so this game is a breath of fresh air - we both enjoy it and it's nice for us to finish playing a game, rather than having to stop when she gets mad. We have fun coming up with "recipes" to make as we harvest as well.

review/text: I have used these pencils for a few hours now. I'm not sure why but some colors blend better then others. The pink and violet blend very badly leaving small white spots even if I use the tinniest bit of water on my brush. I am using watercolor paper but perhaps the paper isn't the right type.The plus side is these have really sparked my interest to look further into higher quality pencils. I will still keep these around but for the first time in my life the art supplies are what is holding me back not my talent. heheThey are ok watercolor pencils but I think I'm going to look into Derwent INKTENSE pencils because judging by youtube videos they work better with water then these.

I found these to be really useful and durable-- although expensive, after I had used the tools for a few weeks I felt it was money well spent. If you are going to use Claybords, you really need these kinds of tools to make the most of your investment.These tools are great for creating fine textures, random textures, fine details, highlights, create line work, and even to completely remove surface pigment to expose the soft white clay coating. The texture tools (wire and needle), eraser tools (fiberglass brush and artist grade steel wool) and two line tools (scratch nibs with wooden holder) offer lots of options. Free sample of Claybord was included with my tools.I've added a photo in customer images to show the different items included.

review/text: Thick juicy color laydown allows for beautifully vibrant artwork, great variety with this collection. Weather you're a fashion designer, interior designer, or just a hobby artist, this set delivers. Be sure to use marker paper to save the lifespan of the markers. Great set for beginners and you can usually find this set for 50% off which is great. The markers life span is pretty decent, I filled 3 sheets 11x17 with black marker for some rough sketches and it still has some juice left. You might want to add a greyscale set to this kit because it only comes with 20/50/70% greyscale of french/cool/warm greys. A fun set.

review/summary: Prismacolor has ruined me on all other art supply brands.
review/text: These markers are absolutely wonderful! I've been a huge fan of Prismacolor colored pencils for years now so I decided I would try something a little different. I really can't use anything but Prismacolor products anymore because no other brand really stands up to their quality.All of the colors are brilliant and also *blend* with eachother instead of bleeding together or leaving you with an unfortunate brown-black. You can even blend totally conflicting colors (think pink and green) and still make out each color. As for colors that naturally blend, they look amazing.I do have a few very minor quips, however. The packaging is a bit cheap compared to the grand quality of the markers themselves and the markers don't want to stay in their individual grooves. Also, the color of the marker on the outside is normally a bit different than what the ink turns out being on paper. So, what I suggest is to take a piece of scrap paper and make a color catalogue (with the names of the colors) so you can see exactly what the finished product will look like.

It might be the problem of my computer monitor since I've never got it color adjusted, most of the color labels on the markers don't match with the color plate on Prismacolor website, and the labels don't match with the actual color of the marker (sorry about the long sentence) I have to look them up by their names. You may want to create your own color plate just as I did, or test each marker out before you use them on your artwork.-it blends beautifully.-the colors are a lot lighter when they are dry.-the package can be better. It doesn't fits the markers perfectly, but I found it convenient as a shelf on my table.in general, I absolutely enjoy working with those markers.

review/summary: I love these markers!
review/text: The title of my review says it all. I absolutely LOVE these markers. They are relatively inexpensive for high-quality art markers, and definitely worth the money. I use these in conjunction with Copic markers and they are a very close match in quality. The only downfall I have encountered with my Prismacolors are the lack of realistic lighter skin tone colors. (Hence why I also use Copic.) I still give them five stars because they are GREAT. Good blending, good shading...just all over nice markers.

review/summary: Well worth the money
review/text: I've been using these for more than a year now, and they are excellent. They do tend to mark the next page as well, so I suggest using some sort of piece of cardboard under the page so as to not stain the next one (in case you're using a sketch book). They don't leave annoying track marks like other markers, they blend in perfectly, and the double-end is a really good thing. You can mark small spaces as well as big with the same marker.

I would recommend that you buy a clear marker blender. I didn't get one with this set. I'm not sure if I was supposed to or not but there wasn't one in there. It does help make the strokes smoother. It has a nice variety of colors for a beginner set.

review/summary: Pleased
review/text: The moment I got these, I was like a little kid on Christmas. I was so excited, I took them right out of the box and placed them up in the 'stand' it came with (basically, six plastic pieces with slots for the markers stacked on top of each other). I even went the extra mile, and instead of waiting until my paper arrived, I went out to buy some marker paper at Michaels (Canson Comic Book Art Boards, really awesome!). The only complaints I have is the marker stand seems cheap, one marker came in with a broken tip, and another one has a dry tip on one side. I'm sure that won't happen to everybody though, and it was a big set, so going out to buy a couple of markers at a time won't be a huge problem for me. I can just see where I need to go from this set :)Hope it was a helpful review!

review/summary: Awesome Cordless Glue Gun
review/text: I had a great time testing out this cordless glue gun. It has several handy features and works very well.I was skeptical about the cordless feature, as some in the past have not worked as well as my corded version. Let me explain how the cordless action works on this glue gun. It is very similar to our cordless drill. The battery snaps into the bottom of the handle. To charge, it fits into a small charger which can be kept anywhere near an outlet. The charger flashes a green light while charging and then a steady light once charged. The initial charge took just a couple of hours. The instructions say the battery has no "memory effect" - it can be put back on the charger even if it's not fully discharged.With the battery, the glue gun weighs less than 12 ounces. It feels very comfortable to hold and use. The glue gun has a trigger so glue only comes out when you need it, and a work light at the tip that illuminates exactly where you are working. The light can be switched from high to low intensity.There's a clear window on top so you can easily see when to add another glue stick. This gun takes mini-size low temperature or all-purpose glue sticks. Cold Heat also sells glue sticks just for this gun, that they say will maximize battery life.Right by the opening for the glue sticks, there are two small lights. One is a low battery indicator and the other is the PowerSave indicator. If you do not move the glue gun for eight minutes, it switches to this mode and stops heating the glue. As soon as you move it, it heats up again.The glue heating time was very quick. The gun is well-made and easy to use. It does not drip when resting, which keeps your workspace much cleaner. The FreeStyle Cordless Glue Gun is packed with features and works great.

review/summary: Great Light Duty Glue Gun
review/text: The cordless feature makes this glue gun very handy. Heat up time is 3 or 4 minutes, and the applicator puts out a nice fine line of glue.But, this is a light duty gun. Too much pressure on the trigger, in an effort to get a faster flow, has the effect of cooling the tip and stopping the flow for a second. Also, that same forcing of the trigger causes the advance mechanism to scrape the top of the glue stick and it won't advance at all till you ease up and slow down.Of course, if you are doing these things, you need a heavier duty glue gun. You can find them at www.glu-stix.com, all the way up to industrial strength with pnumatic force feeders.For most of us, and most of the tasks we want the glue gun for, this one is great.As a side note, the glu-stix.com site has bulk boxes of mini sticks, and special purpose glue sticks as well.

review/summary: Easier and safer Glue Gun
review/text: I just recently purchased this glue gun for craft and home repair use. So far, it lives up to my expectations quite well. Like any product, it has its pros and cons, so allow me to list them.Pros:Cordless products are easier to use anywhere you need them, incuding outside the house.It heats and cools quickly.Unlike most corded glue guns, it has an On/Off switch, and barely drips at all.It has a work light at the front, and a standby mode to conserve battery power.It includes a small idea book that I found very helpful. Read it to learn how to avoid the little strings of glue that can be a problem at the end of a job.You can buy a spare battery for it at coldheat.com. (Other reviewers said batteries were not available, but they just recently started selling them)Cons:It does not come with a storage case, and ColdHeat does not sell one online. (I put it in a small plastic tool box)It uses only Mini sticks (5/16" diameter) so it is good for light work, but if you need a lot of glue, you will have to add sticks frequently.The charging base has an indicator light (a good thing) but it is VERY bright. Don't charge it anywhere near your bedroom at night, or the light will keep you up.My needs are strictly light-duty so it is an excellent choice for me. Gotta go now. I have to look around the house for stuff to glue! :)

review/summary: Amazing gluegun!!!
review/text: This is a great little tool! It is truly cordless, unlike so many others I have looked at that may not have a cord attached to the gun itself, but have a corded base that the gun must be returned to every few minutes. Not this one! It heats up quickly, melts the glue evenly, and is much lighter then I expected it to be yet still feels solid. It does not tip as easily as some glueguns I have used--definite plus. The charge holds for several hours and I like the automatic off feature that saves battery power.All in all it is even better than I hoped it would be.

review/summary: Great while it lasted!.... Batteries Don't Last... GRRRRRR!
review/text: I purchased one shortly before Christmas. Worked great! I used it roughly every two weeks or so for 2 hours at a time.I was lucky enough to have purchased the package that came with two batteries.After a few months of use, the batteries would hold their charge less and less... until finally, one "died" and would no longer hold a charge... then the second battery gave out.I "may" purchase another one... simply for the convenience... and since I use this tool to build items for resale... I might simply consider it a cost of doing business.However, if you are planning on purchasing one for hobby use and expect to get years of use out of it... FORGET IT!I am betting the good reviews here are from people who have only used it for a month or so.Again... I LOVED IT while it worked... now mine is dead!

review/summary: Cold is good, but battery life stinks
review/text: I love the fact that I dont get burned constantly like I did with some of the other guns where the body of the gun would also heat up. There is also less glue 'strings' on projects. The downsides are the balance issue and the battery life. For the price of this little gun, they should be able to provide at least a 4 hour battery life. After less than an hour, the charge light starts blinking. So frustrating!!!! Also , I want to be able to apply glue and quickly set gun down to work with project before glue hardens. I find this gun off balance and spend too much time fidgeting with it to stand up. Not bad, but could use some improvement.

review/text: I've had my unit for a few weeks and have not been able to get more than 15-20 minutes of use from it until it needed to be recharged. Now it appears the battery will not take a charge or the charger is not charging. When I place the battery on the charger it blinks, which indicates it's charging. After hours of charging the light turns solid, which means the battery is fully charged. I place the battery on the glue gun and the low battery lights up and the gun will not heat at all. This product is useless. I went to WalMart and bought a $5 gun that works much better. Save your time and money and do not purchase this product.

The first few times you use this product is works as advertised but the battery has a few months life span and when the battery goes this product is worthless. Tryed calling cold heat but the number is disconnected. I wonder why?. Out of business already.? Spend your money elsewhere. You can do better. I give 0 out of 5 stars. Cannot recommend!!

review/summary: The Last Glue Gun You'll Ever Buy
review/text: I have to admit I was put off by the $30 price tag for a glue gun, but after having worked with it for several months, the convenience of cordless, faster heating time and the powersave feature, it's been worth it. The downside was that from time ordered to actual arrival was painfully slow and the quality of the included glue sticks were less than stellar. But once you have the gun and throw in some glue of you're own, good to go.I looked at their site today and ColdHeat is having a summer sale. Save $5 off and they throw in the painful shipping for free. So now's the time if any. Hope this was helpful!

review/summary: Battery Always Dead - Should be Called a "Poo Gun"
review/text: Like the others mentioned, I loved the idea of a cordless glue gun for tasks around the house, crafts, etc. Using this glue gun, however, has been nothing but frustrating. The battery dies in less than 15 minutes at full charge - even when we let it charge for hours. Becuase there is no way to power the gun via the AC outlet, your project has to stop and wait for over an hour before you get a few more minutes of juice. I thought maybe we got a bum unit, but seeing that someone else has had this exact problem suggests this is a common failure of this product. Stick with the tried and true, and avoid ColdHeat.

review/summary: I wouldn't buy it again
review/text: Other than the convenience factor, this glue gun is junk. The battery is already losing it's charging capacity, after only four months. I can barely use it for 30 minutes, without recharging. You can't buy a replacement battery at all yet, plus there is only a 90 day warranty. The time it takes to heat is longer than 5 minutes. Plus the trigger mechanism refuses to feed the stick most of the time. Save your $30 and buy something else.

review/summary: COLDHEAT Glue Gun Battery Life Blows
review/text: I, like many other reviewers, had this for a very short time when the batteries stopped holding a charge. The unit looks like it's new, but is useless. Wish I had thought to return it to Costco (where I bought it) earlier than after using 6 months. Don't waste your money on this product. Very disappointing.

review/summary: Would be a better value with quality batteries
review/text: Unit worked well for what it is, a small and versatile glue gun for small home repairs and crafts. The batteries are really really bad. And unfortunately they did not build in an adapter to use the included AC plug. That would have been helpful so that when the batteries die we could still use the unit. Bad engineering.Buy a corded gun if you are serious and never worry about batteries again.

review/summary: Fantastic paint set
review/text: These paints have been wonderful. I purchased them for my toddler and they work well. It does take a little bit of practice for them to be able to hold the bottle straight up and down, but my two year old is able to do it. The paints are a wonderful alternative for traditional finger paints (for days when you don't feel like washing down the walls after art time...). They come in vibrant colors, dry quickly, clean up easily and overall are a lot of fun.

review/text: Nothing is ever completely washable... just like these paints! (Crayola advertises this as well and their products don't come out of everything either)I have 4 year old twins who love these. They first started using them in their preschool class. I like them because they dry fast, are easy to use, last a long time, and don't make a big mess-- painting without paint brushes. The ABC do-a-dot alphabet book is a great addition to this set and makes learning letters fun. I'm buying another set for a Christmas gift for a 2 year old.

review/summary: Tips not the same as standard Do-A-Dots
review/text: We have long enjoyed our regular set of Do-A-Dots, so we were excited to give these a try. Unfortunately, jewel-toned colors are just basic colors with jewel names. After our first use, the felt circle tip fell off of one of our markers, and I have tried and tried but can't get it back in. Hopefully the others do not follow. I like the smaller dots, but they are different from the standard sponge tip--much less durable!

review/summary: Mini Do-a-dots markers
review/text: We love our regular Do-a-Dots, and found various coloring pages/printables online that used smaller do-a-dots, so we ordered this mini package. The description of the item isn't terribly detailed, and it was hard to tell if these markers did indeed have a smaller diameter, as they are the same size (and the lid is the same size) as the regular markers. I was pleased to discover that they do in fact make smaller "dots." My main gripe with this particular set is the colors, which aren't quite what we were expecting. The simple bold colors of the Rainbow Do-a-Dot set are much nicer. In this set, for instance, the "ruby red" is not a bright red but sort of a magenta.

review/text: A lot of people recommend this for PCB work. I have found that it scratches PCB's, and doesn't hold them up very well. I use some small spring clamps clipped into to the clips it comes with, it keeps them from scratching whatever I'm working on. If you are going to be doing PCB, you should probably get a Panavise Jr. This product is really good for making cables though. It's good for clipping a connector into one end, and the wire into the other. The magnifying glass is difficult to use while soldering, but it might be better for other uses. You also can't get it far enough away to really see anything.

review/summary: I have one and want another
review/text: I have had mine, the blue one, for a couple of months now. It seems pricey but it really is a great product. I took it to a crop and it held 15 pages in place with all the embellishments on them. Very little slid at all, metal page corners, etc. stayed put. And why take the chance that your half-done pages will be disturbed before you get back to them? Put them into this, zip it up and it stores in very little space against another piece of furniture. I usually have multiple albums going at once, and have limited table space to work on, this really helps. I also find pre-planning my pages makes my crop time a lot more productive. I used boxes before, but things always slid around. It is heavy to carry, probably because of the metal embedded panels, but most people should be able to handle it fine. In short, I think this is a wonderful invention, and am glad I bought it.

review/summary: Doesn't fit some Brother Machines
review/text: I bought this as a spare for my embroidery "Q" foot for my SE350, SE400, LB6800PRW and Singer XL400 but this foot does not fit them. The distance between the screw mount point and the bottom of the foot is about 1 inch, when it needs to be roughly 1/4". Do not get this foot if you are going to use it with a SE350, SE400, LB6800PRW or Singer XL400. The quality looks good, and it looks like it would work better than the stock foot if it would fit, but it will not. I finally found the one for other brother machines. Part number XD0474151, and fits the SE400, the LB6800PRW and the PE-770.I recently got a ULT2001, and this foot works great on that machine for free motion and embroidery.

review/summary: Disappointing
review/text: So many products make promises they don't keep. This is one of them. They say it's tough.Sorry, it's not tough at all!I started making chainmaille jewelry recently and needed the softer jaws on my pliers for the soft metals like aluminum and silver. I have to redip my pliers every week and then they are out of action for 24 hours becuase I let them dry for that length of time. The coating peels off after just a couple of days use. I even tried a friend's suggestion of double dipping but that didn't last either. I'm looking for something more permanent.Beware buying it online as the price is jacked up. It's half the cost from a craft store even with tax added.
